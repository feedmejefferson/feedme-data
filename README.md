## Feedme Data

_Feed me, Jefferson_ is really about data and clever analysis of that data. 

It's one thing to build a web server and a user interface that can let users click on random pictures of food, it's an entirely different thing to serve up meaningful pictures of food that will help them figure out what they're hungry for in as few clicks as possible. 

This repo includes a set of data projects that analyze, transform and create the data that the Feed Me Jefferson app creates and uses to do it's job.
